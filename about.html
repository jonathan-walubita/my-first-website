        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>
            This website was created as a core project for my Interactive Web Development course. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience by exploring, practicing, and enhancing my skills in modern web development. Throughout this process, I focused on mastering the essential technologies of the web: using HTML to create a solid structure and CSS to implement professional styling and layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key objective was to learn how to build web pages that are both functional and visually appealing. I experimented with different layout techniques, color schemes, and typography to create a clean and intuitive user experience. This project provided practical insight into how different design elements work together to form a cohesive and effective website.
        </p>

            Furthermore, this project was a valuable opportunity to strengthen my problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities. I encountered numerous coding and debugging challenges, which required me to research solutions, test different approaches, and persistently refine my work until I achieved the desired result. This iterative process was essential for improving my technical skills and building confidence in my ability to develop functional websites from the ground up.

            In summary, this website represents more than just a course assignment; it is a direct reflection of my journey in learning web development. It showcases my effort to acquire new skills, my willingness to learn from mistakes, and my dedication to improving as a developer. The experience gained from this project has laid a strong foundation for all my future work in web development.
