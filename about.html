        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            This website was created as a core requirement for the Interactive Web Development course. The primary goal was to build a multi-page, responsive website from scratch, applying theoretical knowledge into a practical, real-world project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development process involved several key stages, from creating the basic HTML structure for the Home, About, and Contact pages, to designing a professional and consistent layout with CSS. A significant part of the project was learning and implementing the Git workflow, including creating a repository on GitHub, committing changes, and deploying the final site to GitHub Pages. This project solidifies my understanding of front-end development fundamentals.
